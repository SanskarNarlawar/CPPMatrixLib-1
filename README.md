# `CPPMatrixLib` - A Portable Matrix and Primes Library in C++
This is a simple matrix and primes library, that is built to have a similar interface for matrices as compared to MATLAB or NumPy. This library can be used to detect wheather a given number(large number) is prime or not. This library includes many functions related to primes, like primitive roots function to find primitive root of a prime number, euler function to find the value phi of x and many other functions.  

## Folder wise details:
1) inlude: This folder includes the header files related to prime library which contains all of it's functions.
2) examples/primes: This folder has the demonstration of all the important functions in the library.
3) test: This folder contains the tests written using the frame work of google tests to check the working of all the functions in the library.
4) src: This folder has all the source files at one place.
5) build: This folder has the necessary files which are required to support the use of google tests, basically gtest library and gtest related documents.
Yeah, that's it!!
## Happy Coding
